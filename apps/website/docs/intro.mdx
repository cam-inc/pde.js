# Introduction

## About PDEJS

PDEJS is inspired by Preact's reconciler implements.
We made the implements working standalone for constucting plugins of Editor.js through declarative ui programming.

## Why using Preact's reconciler

We first tried to incorporate React philosophy into the data management in the Editor.js block.
React is a UI library includes a simple architecture concerned with the View of MVC model.
In applications such as block editors that read and write a lot of data, an approach like React is useful because managing data through DOM manipulation is very labor intensive.
Therefore, we used React's mechanisms such as reconciliation and hooks to make data management simple and explicit to improve the development experience.

However, React implementation is complex, even for a reconciler or hooks implementation.
Even if the exact same code could be run standalone, it would require time spent understanding the code, making ongoing maintenance impractical.
Therefore, we decide to utilze Preact for incorporating the React philosophy without relying on React.

Preact is a library known as a lightweight alternative of React.
However, we consider that the superiority of the Preact is not that it is a lighter library than React, but it rewrites React with a minimum amount of code to make it more readable.
Hence, we worked on cloning the implements from Preact's reconciler and adjusted for Editor.js plugin development.
